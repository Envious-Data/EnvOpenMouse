# EnvOpenMouse
 An Open-source mouse for the UK market.
 
### Why?

A lot of friends of mine would like something like a ploopyco mouse but there arent such options avaliable here in the UK and even then custom mouses as a whole is just not very popular.

This will be a open source mouse utilizting the PMW3360 and RP2040.

- Why the RP2040? Why not I say
- Why PMW3360 - its easiest to get and is well known by the community meaning resources are avaliable.

### To do
- Need to verify fit of everything
- firmware
- 3d printable housing
- housing/shell maybe can be made of other matierals
- perhaps write a guide on how to order and get everything made
- contact some vendors to sell this through for those who dont want self assembly
